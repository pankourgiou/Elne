#In this file we will be multiplying many mathematical formulas with given Energy formula. The result will be like we multiply both sides by 1 but we will raise the complexity of it...it's like decorating.
#lne=1
#print("E*lne = lne*mcmod2 = lne*mc**2 = lne*gamma*mcmod2 = E")
#Given Electric potential V = kq/r where k = Coulomb's constant q = electric charge and r = distance from the charge to the point where the potential is measured we have
#print("E*lne*V= lne*mcmod2*(kq/r) = lne*gamma*mcmod2*(kq/r)")
